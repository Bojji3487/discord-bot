## Discord bot made using discord developer portal and Gemini 2.0 Flash model
### How to make this:
### Setup:
1.Firstly I made an app using https://replit.com/~ .It's great for getting dependencies automatically and testing mini apps. Initialize a Python repl in new apps.<br>
2.Go to https://discord.com/developers/ and Sign In with your discord account<br>
3.Create a new app and configure your bot using their highly friendly UI. Go to OAuth2,under URL generator and generate a link.<br>
4.Open link in new tab and you'll be directed to your discord webapp,just select a server to add it to.<br>
### Code:
      1.In the main.py file,paste the developer boilerplate code and customize it according to your preferences.Paste the developer api key.
      2.Next, go to https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs and get a free api key for the model you want to use.
      3.Paste the gemini response boilerplate code into the function.
      4.You need to have at least basic python knowledge to edit it according to your needs.
      5.After all that just run your repl and have fun!!

### To clone this, paste into the terminal:
        git clone https://github.com/Bojji3487/discord-bot.git
